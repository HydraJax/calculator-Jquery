1. No operands yet, enters a operator
--> dont accept operator; except '-' will start a negative number
2. One operand entered, they enter '=' as operator
--> ignore '='
3. One operand entered, they enter a good operator, then enter another operator
--> use most recent operator
4. number, operand, number, operand
--> do 1st calculation between number, operand, number; save second operand
--> left number, 1st operator, right number, 2nd operator ....
--> do calculation between left, op1, right; result => left & op2 becomes op1
